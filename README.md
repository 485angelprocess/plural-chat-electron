# Plural Chat

Messaging app for plural systems / those with DID. Intended for making easier to communicate and organize thoughts and plans between headmates.

Currently features a simple way to switch between users and send messages between each other. Something we do constantly.

The app is build on electron. Requires node and npm to run locally. Run in debug mode by runnin in the root directory:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
